Numeric variables:

"time..." variables are time domain signals
"freq..." variables are frequency domain signals
".mean" and ".std" are mean and standard deviation values
".meanFreq" are "weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency"

X, Y, Z are tri-axial directions. 

All features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
